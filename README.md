================

Orodael Turrim is python based framework game for university subject Knowledge-based systems (BI-ZNS) on FTI CTU Prague.

The purpose of this project is to teach students to create their own planning expert system that can play tower defence. 
The expert system must prepare the defense based on information about the attackers and endure the onslaught of enemies 
as long as possible. The expert system is fully automatic, without external user intervention. All known information 
are provided by the framework itself.

Are you ready to resist the hordes of Rigor Mortis servants?
